Assumptions made while working on this form:
- This form will only be used in the US
- Users are english speaking

Things I learned/ improved on:
- how to validate inputs using javascript
- how to style a form
- how to implement good UX practices for forms such as adding visual indictors and 
different types of inline validation
- prototyping a page layout and it's features
- pseudo coding functions and recognizing where code could be improved on
