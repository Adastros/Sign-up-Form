# Sign-up-Form

## About

This project is a mock sign-up form without a backend. The sign-up form is validated using javascript and provides visual indicators on whether a form field is valid to the user.

Assumptions made while working on this project:

- This form will only be used in the US
- Users are english speaking

The inspiration behind the theme of the webpage stemmed from

</a>
and

Pixiv.
</a>
